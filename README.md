# Budget-Manager
This project will create a simple budget manager using Python dictionaries and classes
# What the program does
This budget manager will allow users to keep track of their expenditures againts an overall budget of 2500. To start, a budget is allocated for different kinds of expenditures, such as groceries and household bills. The expense can then be compared against their allocated budget. A summary is displayed to get a quick overview of the finances.
# Budget planner
Rather than directly creating a program, this project will create a set of functions thatn can be called from the Python shell. These functions can also be imported and used in other programs.
# Function calls
The functions written in this program will allow you to allocate an amount of income to different named budgets. The functions will then track spending against these budgets to see the total amount spent compared to the amount that was budgeted. The diagram below shows an example of making a series of function calls.
# Program design
In this project, functions are added sequentially to create the budget library. Next, a summary of all the expenses is printed. In the end, all the code is converted into a Python class to make it more useful.
